# Delphi "No Code" Library

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Delphi is a development environment that lets you program in Pascal, supported by a lot of integrated tools for designing and deploying projects for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux.

Delphi was designed with RAD (Rapid Application Development) in mind, and continues to be very much in evidence in recent versions, with ever more visual or non-visual components enabling things to be done without having to be coded. However, unlike other software solutions, Delphi does not integrate business objects as standard. This means you have to code your own, or use external libraries.

Many things can be done in "no code" mode in Delphi, but some still require you to write a line or two from time to time.

The sources in this project are designed to get around this "problem" and add functionality to existing elements of the Delphi environment and its components in order to further reduce the number of lines of code needed in applications designed to manage data.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/XXXXXXXXXX).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [YYY](ZZZ) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/YYY subfolder.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/XXXXXXXXXX/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
